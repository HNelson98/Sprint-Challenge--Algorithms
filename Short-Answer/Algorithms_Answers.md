#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)I'm fairly certain that this is logarithmic time O(log n)


b)I thnk this would be linear time O(n)


c)It is only taking in anumber and doing it recursivley the input could be 0 or 10000000000 and it would be the same number of steps, so its Constant O(1)

## Exercise II

In order to ditermine the floor at which you could drop and egg off of with it breaking, using the least amount of eggs. I would have to do a while loop, and have it equal to while egg is unborken. INside the loop i would do a for loop to drop the egg off of each floor untill it breaks the egg. This would be logarithmic time because it would increase based off of the number of floors it takes to break the egg.
